To handle a three-branch strategy with `develop`, `stage`, and `master`, where only certain PRs from `develop` should move to `stage` and then to `master`, you need a controlled approach to manage and merge changes. Here's a step-by-step guide to handle this situation:

### Problem Overview
- **Develop Branch**: Contains all 10 merged PRs.
- **Stage Branch**: Should contain only the 5 PRs that are ready for staging/testing.
- **Master Branch**: Will only include changes that are approved for release after staging/testing.

### Goal
- Merge only the required 5 PRs from `develop` to `stage` and then to `master`.
- Ensure all branches (`develop`, `stage`, `master`) are synchronized after the release.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### 1. **Identify Commits for Staging**

First, identify the 5 PRs or commits in the `develop` branch that you want to move to `stage`. You can do this by checking the commit history:

```bash
git log develop
```

Or use a GUI tool like GitHub or GitLab to view and select the specific commits.

#### 2. **Create a Temporary Branch from `develop`**

Create a new branch from `develop` to isolate the changes that you want to move to `stage`. Let's call this branch `develop-staging`.

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b develop-staging
```

#### 3. **Cherry-Pick Specific Commits to `develop-staging`**

Cherry-pick the specific commits (5 PRs) that you want to move to `stage` from `develop`. This allows you to selectively apply only the commits you need.

For each commit hash you identified:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

Repeat this for all 5 commits you want to move to `stage`.

#### 4. **Merge `develop-staging` into `stage`**

Once you have the correct commits on `develop-staging`, merge this branch into `stage`.

```bash
git checkout stage
git merge develop-staging
```

Resolve any conflicts if they arise during the merge.

#### 5. **Test and Validate on `stage`**

Conduct all necessary testing and validation on the `stage` branch to ensure the changes are ready for release.

#### 6. **Merge `stage` into `master` for Release**

After successful testing, merge the `stage` branch into `master` to prepare for release.

```bash
git checkout master
git merge stage
```

This will bring the approved changes from `stage` into `master`.

#### 7. **Sync `develop` with `master` to Keep Branches Up-to-Date**

To ensure all branches are synchronized, merge the `master` branch back into `develop` after the release.

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge master
```

This will bring any hotfixes or adjustments made during the release process back into the `develop` branch.

#### 8. **Handle Remaining 5 Commits in `develop`**

At this point, `develop` will still be ahead by 5 commits that were not included in the `stage` or `master` branches. These commits remain part of `develop` and can be part of future releases.

If the remaining 5 commits in `develop` are not ready for release, leave them in `develop` until they are ready. If some of them are ready for future staging, repeat steps 2-7 for those specific commits.

#### 9. **Delete Temporary Branches (Optional)**

You can delete the temporary `develop-staging` branch after the successful merge and testing to keep your branch structure clean:

```bash
git branch -d develop-staging
```

#### 10. **Summary of Commands**

```bash
# 1. Identify commits in `develop`
git log develop

# 2. Create a temporary branch from `develop`
git checkout develop
git checkout -b develop-staging

# 3. Cherry-pick specific commits to `develop-staging`
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# 4. Merge `develop-staging` into `stage`
git checkout stage
git merge develop-staging

# 5. Test on `stage` (manual step)

# 6. Merge `stage` into `master` for release
git checkout master
git merge stage

# 7. Sync `develop` with `master`
git checkout develop
git merge master

# 8. Delete temporary branches (optional)
git branch -d develop-staging
```

### Conclusion

This approach ensures that you only move the approved changes from `develop` to `stage` and `master`, keeping your branches clean and synchronized. You retain flexibility by cherry-picking commits, allowing for selective promotion of features or fixes. This strategy also ensures a smooth release process by isolating changes that are not ready for production.




### Alternative Solution for Step 3: Using Interactive Rebase

#### 1. **Create a New Branch for Staging Preparation**

Create a new branch from `develop` that will be used to prepare the commits for `stage`. This branch will include all commits from `develop`, but you will modify its history to exclude the commits you don't want to stage.

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b prepare-stage
```

#### 2. **Interactive Rebase to Remove Unwanted Commits**

Use **interactive rebase** to modify the commit history of the `prepare-stage` branch. This allows you to edit, remove, or reorder commits.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~10  # Adjust the number '10' to match the number of recent commits to review
```

This command opens an editor with a list of the last 10 commits in `prepare-stage`. You will see something like this:

```
pick a1b2c3d Commit message for PR 1
pick d4e5f6g Commit message for PR 2
pick h7i8j9k Commit message for PR 3
...
pick m7n8o9p Commit message for PR 10
```

#### 3. **Remove Unwanted Commits from the Rebase List**

Edit the list to remove the commits you donâ€™t want to include in the `stage` branch. To remove a commit, simply delete its line from the list. After editing, the list should include only the 5 commits that you want to stage:

```
pick a1b2c3d Commit message for PR 1
pick d4e5f6g Commit message for PR 2
pick h7i8j9k Commit message for PR 3
pick q1r2s3t Commit message for PR 8
pick u2v3w4x Commit message for PR 10
```

Save and close the editor. Git will rebase the branch, effectively removing the unwanted commits from the branch history.

#### 4. **Force Push the `prepare-stage` Branch (Optional)**

If you are working with remote branches and you need to share your changes, you may need to force push your changes to overwrite the existing `prepare-stage` branch on the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin prepare-stage --force
```

> **Note**: Be cautious with force pushing, especially if other developers are working on the same branch.

#### 5. **Merge the `prepare-stage` Branch into `stage`**

Once the `prepare-stage` branch has the correct commits, merge it into `stage`:

```bash
git checkout stage
git merge prepare-stage
```

#### 6. **Continue with the Testing and Release Process**

Now, continue with the testing and validation process on the `stage` branch as usual. Once everything is validated, merge `stage` into `master` for release and sync back to `develop` to ensure all branches are aligned.

#### 7. **Delete the Temporary Branch (Optional)**

After completing the merge and release process, you can delete the temporary `prepare-stage` branch:

```bash
git branch -d prepare-stage
```

### Conclusion

Using **interactive rebase** is a powerful alternative to `git cherry-pick` when you want more control over the commit history and wish to avoid cherry-picking multiple commits manually. This approach provides a clean and concise way to prepare specific changes for staging and production environments.
